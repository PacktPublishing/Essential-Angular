# Essential Angular Book Example Application

## Book

You can find the Essential Angular book [here](http://leanpub.com/essential_angular). This book aims to be a short, but at the same time, fairly complete overview of the key aspects of Angular: it covers the framework's mental model, its API, and the design principles behind it. 

## Examples

I use the same application in all the examples in this book. This application is a list of tech talks that you can filter, watch, and rate.

## How to Use

* Clone this github repo
